# Key Components
## Importance / Severity Box
The upper left of each task indicates the importance or severity of the action.

The inner box being somewhere on the left side indicates HIGH SEVERITY - meaning not completing the action will be very costly to the organization

The inner box being somewhere on the top indicates HIGH IMPORTANCE - meaning completion of the action will result in valuable gains to the orgnaization.

The number in the box represents the number of days remaining.

Tasks are generally sorted in the following manner: severity then importance then days remaining. An exception is when a task is marked as being worked on, in which case the task is moved to the top.

## Working on Tab
The upper right has a toggleable tab for someone who is assigned a task to indicate it is being worked on *today*. This tab will revert to unmarked overnight.

## My Tasks / Tasks I've Assigned
The menu bar on the upper left allows for switching between screens, including the *Tasks I've Assigned* screen. This contains any tasks where others are reporting to me.

## Editing / Comments / Adding Tasks
Tasks can be edited, added, or commented on by clicking the respected links.

## Invite Someone To the Team
In the menu is an option to invite someone to the team. This will send an email address with an invitation link, so that the person can create an account within the team. Someone who wants to create a new team can log out and go through the steps on the splash page
